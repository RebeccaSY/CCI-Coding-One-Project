This design is a space with floor, walls, and sculptures. It’s not an enclosed space, but presents the feeling of limitation. 

The whole model is based on a floor. The white feathers (Image by @macrovector on Freepik) keep moving on the ground, representing the time passed. These images are attached on the material of the plane to be part of the animation. The moving velocity and rotation is decided by random within a range. The starting point is a random position on the plane within the cage. The feathers repeat continuous movement from the cage to the whole floor plane. 

The background music is “The Promise” from the movie The Promise, a fantasy film in 2005. The design of round elements, including the cage in the middle, is also inspired by the movie. The world is limitless. But we always have to sacrifice something in order to obtain something, which is the limitation for us. I divided the space into several parts, each containing some models. 

The top view of the spatial layout is exactly symmetrical. I used loops to set up the layout. The gradient materials are drawn in Illustrator and exported into the project. I put 2D animation on the screens in front of the walls in the middle. The pattern changes periodically in scale and opacity. The light source of the model mainly comes from the hollow sphere located in the middle. There is a point light inside it. There is also directional light in the environment. 

There are two circles of walls. All of them are semi transparent. The walls are positioned equally along the circles, allowing limited light from the centre. The space between the two circles of walls is relatively dark. I made it into a small gallery, showing 6 sculptures. The design of sculptures considered geometry shape, material, animation in position, rotation, scale and opacity. The sculptures are floating above the containers. The containers of the sculptures are circles with light rays going up. They are made of cylinders with customised material. 

The user can view this design with the movement of my camera. I drew a curve with some positions and attached the camera to move with the curve. The moving progress is updated in the animation. I used one set of points to store the positions which the camera should go through, and another set of points to store the points ahead of the camera position on the curve. The second set of points is used to control where the camera looks when exploring the gallery. When the user enters the middle circle, the camera will point to the ball at the centre. Finally, it goes out of the cage then looks back for a top view.
